# Welcome

Hello! I'm **Henry Goodman**, a professional **Software Engineer** from Sydney, with experience in **full-stack development** and a passion for creating impactful and efficient software solutions.

## My Current Role

I’m a mid-Level Software Engineer at Toshiba Australia, working on full-stack embedded applications for enterprise solutions.
I focus on creating reliable and efficient software that powers multifunction devices and streamlines workflows.

## My Main Project: [Woolies Watcher](https://woolieswatcher.com)

[Woolies Watcher](https://woolieswatcher.com) is a near-real-time grocery tracking tool, built to help users monitor prices and updates for their favorite products.  
This is my primary side project, hosted at the **[Woolies Watcher GitHub Repository](https://github.com/henrygoodman/woolies-watcher)**.

- **Built with**:
  - Backend: Express and PostgreSQL
  - Frontend: React and Tailwind CSS
  - Deployed via Docker on DigitalOcean.

## Advent of Code

I’m a big fan of **[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com)**—a series of programming puzzles released every December.
It’s a fun way to sharpen my problem-solving skills and explore new languages.

Here’s what I’ve done so far:

- **2023**: Used **Rust** to focus on efficient, low-level solutions.
- **2024**: Tackled the challenges in **Go**, exploring concurrency and performance.

Each year, I look forward to the new puzzles and the chance to learn something new.
